# CodeAlpha_CGPA-Calculator
An advanced CGPA Calculator built using C++17 with modern programming practices including RAII, exception handling, templates, STL, and file persistence. Developed using Visual Studio Code during the CodeAlpha Internship.
# CGPA Calculator (C++17)

An advanced, console-based CGPA Calculator developed using modern C++17 standards and best practices.  
This project was implemented during the CodeAlpha Internship with a focus on robustness, maintainability, and clean architecture.

## Key Features
- Multi-semester CGPA calculation
- Semester-wise GPA computation
- Robust input validation using templates
- Custom exception handling for invalid data
- File persistence (save and load academic data)
- Menu-driven interactive interface
- Precision-controlled output formatting

## Technical Highlights
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- RAII for safe resource management
- Const-correctness and move semantics
- STL containers and algorithms
- Lambda expressions
- Exception-safe file handling

## Technologies Used
- Language: C++ (C++17 standard)
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Compiler: g++ (MinGW)
- Platform: Console Application

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 cgpa.cpp -o cgpa
./cgpa

## Internship Details
- Organization: CodeAlpha
- Domain: C++ Programming
